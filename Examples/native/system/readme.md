### System programming examples
 A bunch of tests, found on the internet, modified and rebuilded for nasm
 I do not find any other name for these examples .... anyway, these are not 'common programs'

#### bootloader16
 example addapted from [mikeos](http://mikeos.sourceforge.net/)
 builds iso image from floppy image (root permissions for mounting)
#### bootloader64
 example from [osdev wiki](http://wiki.osdev.org/Entering_Long_Mode_Directly)
 boots from CD into 64bit long mode and gone is all BIOS support.
 this example gives a glimps on how someone can solve it.
