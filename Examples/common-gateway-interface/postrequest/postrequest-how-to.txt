 How to test:  in a terminal type export CONTENT_LENGTH=[value for content length]
               start the application
               once 'parameters stripped from HTTP header: <i><b>' is on screen you can type your
               parameter-value pairs like an url string and press enter.
               You should see those in the output.
               example: export CONTENT_LENGTH=14
               as input a=10&b=20&c=30.

Remark:        Check if apache module cgi and fastcgi is enabled. On my test system
               this program gives initially a connection reset error.  This is because
               cgi, fastcgi or cgid wasn't enabled.
               Apparently mod-cgi is not enough to serve this program.
               sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-fastcgi
               sudo a2enmod fastcgi
               sudo service apache2 restart
