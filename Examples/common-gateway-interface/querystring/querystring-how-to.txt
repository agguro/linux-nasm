 How to test:  To test this application on the commandline you can export the QUERY_STRING with his value.
                  example in a terminal : export QUERY_STRING='=fname=firstname&lname=lastname&age=99'

Remarks:       1: Check if apache module cgi and fastcgi is enabled. On my test system
                  this program gives initially a connection reset error.  This is because
                  cgi, fastcgi or cgid wasn't enabled.
                  Apparently mod-cgi is not enough to serve this program.
                  sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-fastcgi
                  sudo a2enmod fastcgi
                  sudo service apache2 restart

               3: If you like to observe the network traffic, you can use:
                  sudo tcpdump -i lo -s0 -w capture.pcap to capture the network traffic in a file
                  which you can open with wireshark.
