# modern-x86-assembly-language-programming-linux
Source code for 'Modern X86 Assembly Language Programming' by Daniel Kusswurm, 'translated' to nasm and g++ for Linux.

This repository isn't complete. Some examples still need to be translated especially those with GDI libraries.  In time I want to use SDL for that.

The original license is : https://github.com/Apress/modern-x86-assembly-language-programming/blob/master/LICENSE.txt and repeated in this repository.

On 64 bit Linux you have to

apt-get install gcc-multilib g++-multilib

to build 32 bit examples when Linux is 64 bits
