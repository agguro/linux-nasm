Remarks:    Check if apache module cgi and fastcgi is enabled. On my test system
            this program gives initially a connection reset error.  This is because
            cgi, fastcgi or cgid wasn't enabled.
            Apparently mod-cgi is not enough to serve this program.
            sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-fastcgi
            sudo a2enmod fastcgi
            sudo service apache2 restart

            If you like to observe the network traffic, you can use:
            sudo tcpdump -i lo -s0 -w capture.pcap to capture the network traffic in a file
            which you can open with wireshark.

The example assumes there is a folder named 'downloads' with a file named 'logo.png'.
