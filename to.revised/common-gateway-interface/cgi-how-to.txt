; How to test:  in a terminal type export CONTENT_LENGTH=[value for content length]
;               start the application
;               once 'parameters stripped from HTTP header: <i><b>' is on screen you can type your
;               parameter-value pairs like an url string and press enter.
;               You should see those in the output.
;               example: export CONTENT_LENGTH=14
;               as input a=10&b=20&c=30.

;Remark:        Check if apache module cgi and fastcgi is enabled. On my test system
;               this program gives initially a connection reset error.  This is because
;               cgi, fastcgi or cgid wasn't enabled.
;               Apparently mod-cgi is not enough to serve this program.
;               sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-fastcgi
;               sudo a2enmod fastcgi
;               sudo service apache2 restart

; To test this application on the commandline you can export the QUERY_STRING with his value.
; example in a terminal : export QUERY_STRING='=fname=firstname&lname=lastname&age=99'

; Remark:      For those who like to observe the network traffic, you can use:
;              sudo tcpdump -i lo -s0 -w capture.pcap to capture the network traffic in a file
;              which you can open with wireshark.

; (It could be the binary of this program too.)
; If you should see errors instead of a download window check if fastcgi is enabled on your apache server.
; appearantle mod-cgi alone isn't enough to serve this program
; sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-fastcgi
; sudo a2enmod fastcgi
; sudo service apache2 restart
