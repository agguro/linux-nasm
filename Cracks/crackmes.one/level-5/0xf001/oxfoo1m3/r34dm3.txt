its cool you try this crackme. i am very courious on how 
hard u find it, and any opinions or feedback!

i hand crafted this binary in asm (NASM) for your pleasure ;]

i have included some anti libbfd-stuff, anti-disassembling,
and anti-debugging stuff, though it is not so scary you will see.

i have mixed some techniques i saw in a malware and included
my own special features.
