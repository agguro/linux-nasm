# Question 187



What kinds of polymorphism exist and what is the difference between them?


# Answer



### Subtype polymorphism 

An entity of type `B` is always of type `A` as well.

### Parametric polymorphism 

It looks like a function accepts an explicit type argument.

### Ad-hoc polymorphism 
The same code acts differently on different types (overloading)

### Coercion 
Implicitly convert from one type into another when needed.
