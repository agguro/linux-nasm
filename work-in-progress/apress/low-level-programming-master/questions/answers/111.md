# Question 111


What are the shadow registers?


# Answer



A register that is not directly accessible but that is used as a cache for a
certain memory value. It can be used implicitly by CPU instead of reading the
said value from memory. 

For example, the current segment descriptors that correspond to the entries in GDT pointed
at by `cs`, `ds`, `ss` are stored in shadow registers to prevent reading them from
GDT at every memory access.
