What is an interrupt?


# Answer




This is a controlled violation of the sequential execution of a program. 
Interrupts allows one to change program execution order based on events external to
the program itself. 

After a signal (external or internal) is caught, a programâ€™s execution is suspended, some
registers are saved, and the CPU starts executing a special routine to handle the situation. Following are
exemplary situations when an interrupt occurs (and an appropriate piece of code is executed to handle it):
* A signal from an external device (external interrupt).
* Zero division (internal interrupt).
* Invalid instruction (when CPU failed to recognize an instruction by its binary
representation -- internal interrupt).
* An attempt to execute a privileged instruction in a non-privileged mode (internal interrupt).
