# Question 46


Read about microcode in general and processor pipelines.


# Answer




Microcode is the program code one level _below_ assembly, that is used to 
encode the logic of complex instructions. It is not accessible to programmer
and virtually everything about it is a trade secret of computer manufacturer.

The processor pipeline allows you to execute multiple microcode instructions 
at time, if they use different parts of CPU. It is a great performance
booster.

This document contains a good insight on these topics:
