What is a symbol table? What kind of information does it store?


# Answer



In ELF files, this table stores information about all object symbols. An object
symbol usually corresponds to a label in assembly file. Linker can use it to 
e.g. link the usage of a global variable, declared in one file, to its absolute
address. This address is only known after relocation, so it is the linker's 
responsibility to fill it.
