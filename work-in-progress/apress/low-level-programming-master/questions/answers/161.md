    How to compute how many elements does an array store using `sizeof`?


# Answer



```c
int main() {
    int a[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    printf( "%zu", sizeof( a ) / sizeof( *a ) );
    return 0;
}
```

It only works when the array is created globally or in the same scope. As long 
as you pass a pointer to an array somewhere, `sizeof(a)` will evaluate to the
size of the pointer, and not to the total size of array.
