# Question 257



What is the data structure padding? Is it portable?


# Answer



It means that the fields of structures may not be placed one immediately
after another in memory. There may be gaps between them.  It is of course not
portable to change this parameter, for example, because on some architectures
unaligned accesses to memory result in hardware fault.
