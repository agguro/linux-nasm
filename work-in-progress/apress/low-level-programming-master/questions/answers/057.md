What is the virtual address space? How is it different from the
physical one?


# Answer




Physical address space is unique. It enumerates  the cells of physical memory. 
Virtual address space is created for each process, and the user programs
operate such virtual addresses. Any address you are using is from the 
virtual realm. 

Some of the virtual addresses are then mapped to physical addresses based on 
which parts of virtual address spaces are needed right now and in close future.
