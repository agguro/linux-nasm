What is the string interning? 


# Answer



When multiple occurrences of the same string literal lead to the string itself
being placed exactly once in __.rodata__. For example, only one copy of the
string "hello" will be placed in __.rodata__:

```c
char* a = "Hello";
char* b = "Hello";
char* c = "Hello";
char* d = "Hello";
char* e = "Hello";
```
It is very likely that a == b ( == c == d == e) in this example.
