# Question 287



What is the use of `restrict`?  


# Answer



It helps the compiler to perform certain optimizations because it guarantees
that a certain data element is only accessed through a certain pointer.
If the data can be modified through other pointers, it prohibits certain 
optimizations, for example:

```c
int x = 1;
while( x ) {
    // code that does not mention `x`
}
```

This loop can be optimized out to a `jmp` instruction to restart it without
checking any conditions. However, it requires that no pointer to `x` exists,
otherwise that pointer can be used to modify `x`.
