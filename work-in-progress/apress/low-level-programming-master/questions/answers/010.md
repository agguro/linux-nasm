Can we count elements in stack?


# Answer




We never know, how many elements are in stack.  We can execute `pop`
instruction as many times as we like, and we will always get something from the
memory. Each time the `rsp` value will increase. 

So, no, we are unable to reason about the amount of elements in stack at all.
