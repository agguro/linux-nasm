# Question 97


Is the `TF` flag cleared automatically when entering interrupt handlers?
Refer to [Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual].


# Answer




It depends on the interrupt descriptors (aka __gates__). There are two types of them: trap gates and interrupt gates.
For _interrupt gates_ the interrupt handling is automatically disabled once CPU enters the interrupt handler.
