# Question 51


What will happen if you try to modify the program execution code during its
execution?


# Answer




The code segment is usually protected from being overwritten. An attempt to
write results in a hardware exception and is handled by OS. The OS usually
kills the process right away. You will see the error message `Segmentation fault`.
