What are enumeration types? What is their difference from the structure types?


# Answer



The enumeration types have nothing in common with structural types. 

An enumeration type declares an integer type that can hold one of predefined
constant values, for example:

```c
enum direction {
    NORTH,
    EAST,
    SOUTH,
    WEST
    };
    
...

enum direction mydirection = SOUTH;
```
