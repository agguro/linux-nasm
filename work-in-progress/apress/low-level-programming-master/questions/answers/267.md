# Question 267



 What are `xmm` registers? How many are they? 


# Answer



There are 16 xmm registers: `xmm0` ... `xmm15`.
They are mostly used for floating point arithmetic and for SIMD operations such
as packed multiply. 
Usually if you are working with the floating point numbers in assembly, you are
using these registers to hold the values, because the functions accept the
floating point arguments in `xmm` registers as well.
