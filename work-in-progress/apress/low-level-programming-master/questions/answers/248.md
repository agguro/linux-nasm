# Question 248



 Why are regular languages less expressive than context-free grammars?


# Answer



They can not parse recursive structures. For example, in HTML documents, any
paragraph can include multiple paragraphs:

```html
<div>
    <div>First</div>
    <div>Second</div>
    <div>Third</div>
    ...
</div>
```

Each of the subparagraphs can include other subparagraphs and that is going
as deep as we want. We can not express a propriety "a part of a non-terminal
is similar in structure to the non-terminal itself", the non-terminal being
kind of fractal nature.
