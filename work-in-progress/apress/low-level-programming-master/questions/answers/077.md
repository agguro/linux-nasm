# Question 77


What is the linked list?


# Answer



It is a data structure consisting of nodes:

* Each node contains an element and a link to the next element.
* The address of the first node defines the linked list.
* The last node's next element address is set to 0. By convention no element
can reside at this address. 

For example, here is a hardcoded linked list of integers 1, 2 and 3 in assembly:

```asm
elem1:

dq 1
dq elem2     ; the address of the second element

elem3:       ; The elements can be in whatever order you like,
             ; because they all hold addresses of their successors anyway
dq 3
dq 0         ; no successor for the last element

elem2: 

dq 2
dq elem3
```
