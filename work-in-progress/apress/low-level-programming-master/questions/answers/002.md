# Question 2

 
What are the key principles of von Neumann architecture? 


# Answer




* Memory stores only bits (a unit of information, a value equal to 0 or 1).
* Memory stores both encoded instructions and data to operate on. There are no means
to distinguish data from code: both are in fact bit strings.
* Memory is organized into cells, which are labeled with their respective indices in
a natural way (e.g., cell #43 follows cell #42). The indices start at 0. Cell size may
vary (John von Neumann thought that each bit should have its address); modern
computers take one byte (eight bits) as a memory cell size. So, the 0-th byte holds the
first eight bits of the memory, etc.
* The program consists of instructions that are fetched one after another. Their
execution is sequential unless a special jump instruction is executed.

There might be additional points, which are of a little importance to us, such as:

* The architecture is fixed, no new links appear between its parts.
