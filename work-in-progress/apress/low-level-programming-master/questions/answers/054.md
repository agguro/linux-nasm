# Question 54


What are the translation tables?


# Answer




These tables are used to perform address translation. In case of 4KB pages,
there are four levels of them: 
* PML4
* PDP
* PD
* PT

There is only one PML4 table per address space (which is unique for each
process). Each table at any level contains up to 512 entries (4 KB / 8 bytes per
entry). Each entry stores either a part of the address of the table of the next
level, or, at the last level, the physical address of the page frame.
