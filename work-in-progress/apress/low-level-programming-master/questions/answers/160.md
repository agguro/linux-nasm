# Question 160




What will be the value of `x`?

```c
int x = 10;
size_t t = sizeof(x=90);
```


# Answer



`sizeof` can be read as "what would be the size of  a value if we compute this expression?". It does _not_ evaluate it. So, `x` is still equal to 10.

`sizeof(x=90)` will be replaced with 4 during the program compilation.
