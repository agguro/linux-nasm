# Question 216



 What arithmetic operations can you perform with pointers, and on what 
        conditions?


# Answer



* Add or subtract an integer (including negatives)
* Subtract a pointer (but the result is only defined when it points to one of
preceding elements of the same contiguous memory block).
* Compare pointers ( like, `x > y` or `x == y`). The less/greater comparison only 
makes sense for the pointers into the same contiguous memory block.
