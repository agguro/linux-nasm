# Question 143


When an integer literal is encountered, do interpreter and compiler
behave alike?


# Answer



No, the interpreter puts it into stack directly, while compiler should emit 
`lit` instruction first. An exception would be when a number occurs immediately
after `branch` or `0branch` words.
