# Question 69


Check the preprocessor output on file, shown in Listing
`defining_in_cla.asm`:
```asm
%ifdef flag
hellostring: db "Hello",0
%endif 
```


# Answer




By launching `nasm -E defining_in_cla.asm` we get the following output:

```asm
%line 1+1 test.asm
```

As we see, the file became empty because `hellostring` is not created. The
lines between `%ifdef` and `%endif` will only be included if `flag` is defined
using `%define flag` directive or `-Dflag` compiler option
