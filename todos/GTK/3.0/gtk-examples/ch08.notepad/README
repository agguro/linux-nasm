This code has the RTF interpreter added which the book did not have.
The code reads an RTF file and converts it to text to be displayed
in the editor.  This does not save back out in RTF format.

I did not write the code, but found it and included it here because
my book was originally written in RTF and people were using the 
program to read the book.
