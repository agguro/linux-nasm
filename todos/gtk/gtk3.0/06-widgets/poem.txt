I've always been too lame
To see what's before me
And I know nothing sweeter than
Champaign from last New Years
Sweet music in my ears
And a night full of no fears

But if I had one wish fulfilled tonight
I'd ask for the sun to never rise
If God passed a mic to me to speak
I'd say "Stay in bed, world",
Sleep in peace

---The Cardigans Lyrics---
