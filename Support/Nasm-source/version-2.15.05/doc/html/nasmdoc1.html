<h3 id="section-1.1">1.1 What Is NASM?</h3>
<p>The Netwide Assembler, NASM, is an 80x86 and x86-64 assembler designed
for portability and modularity. It supports a range of object file formats,
including Linux and *BSD <code>a.out</code>, ELF, Mach-O, 16-bit and 32-bit
<code>.obj</code> (OMF) format, COFF (including its Win32 and Win64
variants.) It can also output plain binary files, Intel hex and Motorola
S-Record formats. Its syntax is designed to be simple and easy to
understand, similar to the syntax in the Intel Software Developer Manual
with minimal complexity. It supports all currently known x86 architectural
extensions, and has strong support for macros.</p>
