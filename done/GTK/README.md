# GTK Source Code - Linux

The source code for GTK programming on Linux with NASM is moved to his own repository.

GTK1 : is obsolete but I've add examples from the internet, just to have some nioce ideas.
can be found in the [*repository of steshaw*](https://github.com/steshaw/gtk-examples)
or on my github here.

GTK2 : examples from ZetCode, myself, the internet etc...
(https://github.com/agguro/gtk-nasm/tree/GTK2)

GTK3 : examples from GTK2 build for use with GTK3
(https://github.com/agguro/gtk-nasm/tree/GTK3)

or by cloning directly: 

git clone https://github.com/agguro/gtk-nasm
checkout GTK1 (or GTK2 or GTK3)

changes in the branches aren't merged with main to keep all diferences separated.
GTK1 is merely sentimental and of no use unless you wan't ideas.
