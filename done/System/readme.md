### System programming examples
   A bunch of tests, found on the internet, modified and rebuilded for nasm. I do not find any other name for these examples .... anyway, these are not 'common programs'

#### bootloader16
   example adapted from [mikeos](http://mikeos.sourceforge.net/)
   builds iso image from floppy image (root permissions for mounting)
#### bootloader64
   example from [osdev wiki](http://wiki.osdev.org/Entering_Long_Mode_Directly)
   boots from CD into 64bit long mode and gone is all BIOS support.
   this example gives a glimps on how someone can solve it.
 #### elf64header
   demo on how to writre really tiny programs from [muppetlabs](http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/tiny/teensy.html) and [markloiseau blog](http://blog.markloiseau.com/2012/05/tiny-64-bit-elf-executables/)

   [Qemu](https://www.qemu.org/) to run the examples
