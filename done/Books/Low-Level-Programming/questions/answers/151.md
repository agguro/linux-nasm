# Question 151



 What is a block of statements?


# Answer




* Statements are grouped in __blocks__ using brackets:

```c
void f(void) {

    int x;
    int y;

    {           // block start
        int z;
        int k = 42;
        z = k + 1; 
    }           // block end
    
    puts( "hey" );
}
```

* Blocks can be placed inside one another. 
* Block is itself considered like a singular statement. 
* You can declare local variables _only_ at the block start, but _not_ necessarily in the topmost block of a function body, as you have seen on the example above. `z` and `k` are variables
that do not exist outside their block (e.g. at `puts` function call, they are not accessible anymore).
