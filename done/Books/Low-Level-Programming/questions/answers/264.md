# Question 264



 Can you imagine a situation, when a function, not a macro, accepts a
    variable by name (syntactically) and changes it? What should be the 
    type of such variable?


# Answer



Yes, it is possible. For example, you can provide this macro with an array name:

```c
#define CH( a ) a[0]++;

int array[10] = {0};

CH( array )
```
