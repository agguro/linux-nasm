# Question 94


Which are the two different kind of libraries?


# Answer




Static and dynamic.

* Static libraries are the same thing as `.o` files: they are relocatable object
files that will be inlined into the resulting executable by the linker.
* Dynamic libraries are shared object files. They are compiled and linked separately,
but an entity called dynamic linker should perform a special relocation job on them 
before they can be executed as a part of some running process.
