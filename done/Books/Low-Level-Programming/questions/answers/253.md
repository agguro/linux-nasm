# Question 253



What are the cases of undefined behavior in C?


# Answer



Some cases include:
* Signed integer overflow.
* Dereferencing an invalid pointer.
* Comparing the pointers to elements of two different memory blocks.
* Calling function with arguments that do not match its initial signature (possible by making a pointer to it and casting to other function type).
* Reading from an uninitialized local variable.
* Division by 0.
* Accessing an array element out of its bounds.
* Attempting to change a string literal.
* The return value of a function, which does not have an executed return statement.
