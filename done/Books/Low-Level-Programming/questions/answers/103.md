# Question 103


How is #PF error related to the swapping? How does the operating system
use it?


# Answer



When a page is swapped out to disk, the `P` bit in the relevant __page table entry__
is set to zero, because the page is not present in physical memory anymore. 
Accessing addresses on this page results in a page fault exception, which enables
the operating system to load the page contents into memory.
