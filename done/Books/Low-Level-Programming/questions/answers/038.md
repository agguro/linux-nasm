What is the program return code?


# Answer



The return code (or _exit status_) of a program is a number it returns to
signify its execution status. If it executed correctly, the convention is to
return 0. Otherwise, we return an error code. It is a programmer's 
responsibility to map these codes to abnormal situations in the code.

The assembly programs return the exit status by passing it to the
`exit` system call as its first argument (in `rdi`).
