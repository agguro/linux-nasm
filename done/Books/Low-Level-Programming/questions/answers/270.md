# Question 270



What registers are used to pass arguments to functions? 


# Answer


    
    * `rdi`, `rsi`, `rdx`, `rcx`, `r8`, and `r9`
    * `xmm0` to `xmm7`
    * If a function has a variable number of arguments, `rax` holds the amount
    of `xmm` registers actually used for arguments during this specific call.
