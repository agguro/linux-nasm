What are structure  types and why do we need them? 


# Answer



A structure type is a pair/triple/... of fields which can be treated as a whole.
For example, the structures of the following type hold a pointer to a null-terminated string and its length:

```c
struct str {
    char const* text;
    size_t size;
    };
```
