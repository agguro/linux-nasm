What is a finite automaton?


# Answer



It is the synonym for "Finite State Machine".

__Deterministic finite state machine__ (deterministic finite automaton) is an
abstract machine that acts on input string, following some rules.  
The following parts should be provided:

1.  A set of states.
2.  Alphabet -- a set of symbols that can appear in the input string.
3.  A selected start state.
4.  One or multiple selected end states
5.  Rules of transition between states. Each rule consumes a symbol from input string.
Its action can be described as: "if automaton is in state S and an input symbol C
occurs, the next current state will be Z."
