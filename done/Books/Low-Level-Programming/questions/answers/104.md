# Question 104


Can we implement system calls using interrupts?


# Answer



Yes, we can actually implement system calls using any instruction that results in an interrupt. Before `syscall` was introduced, `int 0x80` was used to access system calls on Linux, but in reality the choice is arbitrary. We can even use incorrectly encoded instruction to do it, because it results in #UD exception.
