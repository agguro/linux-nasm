# Question 254



What are the cases of unspecified behavior in C?


# Answer



    For example:
* The function argumentâ€™s evaluation order is not specified. It means that while
evaluating `f(g(), h())` we have no guarantees that `g()` will be evaluated first and `h()` second. However, it is guaranteed that both `g()` and `h()` will be evaluated before `f()`.
*	 The order of subexpression evaluation in general, `f(x) + g(x)`, does not enforce `f` to
be executed before `g`. Unspecified behavior describes the cases of non-determinism in
the abstract C machine.
