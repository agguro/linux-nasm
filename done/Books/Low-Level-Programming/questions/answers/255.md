What are sequence points?


# Answer



* Sequence points are the places in the program where the state of the abstract
machine is coherent to the state of the target machine.
* Equivalently, they are places in the program where the side effects of
previous expressions are already applied, but the side effects of the following
ones are not yet applied.
