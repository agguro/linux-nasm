# Question 65


Can we write a string in `.text` section? What happens if we read it?
And if we overwrite it?


# Answer



Yes, we can store a string in `.text`. We are able to read it, but not 
overwrite it, because the pages that correspond to `.text` are marked read-only
via W bit in their Page Table Entries.
