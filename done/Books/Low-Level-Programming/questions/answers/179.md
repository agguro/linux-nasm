# Question 179



How are the arguments passed to the `main` function?


# Answer



The command line arguments are passed as arguments to `main`. This function
accepts two arguments:
* `argc` how many arguments were passed?
* `argv` the arguments themselves; an array of pointer to strings.


For example, `argv[0]` is the name of the program itself, 
`argv[1]` is the first arguments.
