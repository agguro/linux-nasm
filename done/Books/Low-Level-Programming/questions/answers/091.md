# Question 91


Is there a connection between sections and segments?


# Answer



* Section is a static phenomenon, whereas segments are created in runtime. 
* Sections are declared in section header, segments are declared in program headers.
* Each segment is a container for one or several sections. 
* Not all sections are put into segments (and are loaded at all -- e.g., __line__).
* Segments define permissions for the virtual pages they consist of. If multiple
data sections are put inside one segment, they will all be e.g. non-executable.
