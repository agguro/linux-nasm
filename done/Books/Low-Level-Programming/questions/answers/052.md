# Question 52


What are forbidden addresses?


# Answer



Forbidden addresses do not correspond to any pages in page tables of the 
current process. They are just not allocated. Hence an attempt to use them
for reading or writing into memory results in a hardware exception and is 
handled by OS. It usually involves killing current process right away. You
will see the error message `Segmentation fault`.
