# Question 184



What are union types? What is their difference from the structure types?


# Answer



Union types are like structures, but their fields are overlapping. While the
size of a structure is equal or greater to the sum of the field sizes,
the size of a union is the maximum of its field sizes.

```c
union value {
    char as_char[4];
    short as_short[2];
    int as_int;
    };
```
