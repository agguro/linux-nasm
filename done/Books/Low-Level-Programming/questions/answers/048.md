# Question 48


Read about meaning of the fourth (`08:01`) and fifth
(`144225`) column in `man procfs`.


# Answer




Here is a relevant listing, showing the contents of `/proc/2186/maps` file:

```
> cat /proc/2186/maps
00400000-00401000 r-xp 00000000 08:01 144225 /home/stud/main
00600000-00601000 rwxp 00000000 08:01 144225 /home/stud/main
7fff11ac0000-7fff11ae1000 rwxp 00000000 00:00 0 [stack]
7fff11bfc000-7fff11bfe000 r-xp 00000000 00:00 0 [vdso]
7fff11bfe000-7fff11c00000 r--p 00000000 00:00 0 [vvar]
ffffffffff600000-ffffffffff601000 r-xp 00000000 00:00 0 [vsyscall]
```

This file corresponds to the memory map of the process with ID equal to 2186.

`08:01` corresponds to the device major and minor numbers. In case of disks
it often means the disk number and partition. `144225` corresponds to the 
[inode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inode) of the respective file.

Anonymous pages correspond to no file in filesystem, thus their respective 
fields contain stub zeros.
