# Question 275



What are prologue and epilogue?


# Answer



The function code is usually enclosed inside a pair of prologue and epilogue,
which are similar for all functions. Prologue helps initialize the stack frame, and
epilogue deinitializes it.

Prologue looks like that:

```asm
push rbp
mov rbp, rsp
sub rsp, <total size of local variables>
    ```

Epilogue usually looks like that:

```asm
leave
ret
```

or

```asm
mov rsp, rbp
pop rbp
ret
```
