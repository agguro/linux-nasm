What is the dynamic memory allocation? 


# Answer



Dynamic memory allocation allows for allocation of blocks of size unknown at
compilation time. While global or local arrays should have fixed size, 
dynamic memory block size can be decided during program execution. For example,
it can depend on user input.

Such blocks are allocated in heap, a dedicated memory region.

The function `malloc` / `calloc`, `realloc` and `free` are used to work with
dynamic memory allocation.
