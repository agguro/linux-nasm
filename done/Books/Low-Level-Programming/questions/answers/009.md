# Question 9


Can the stack be empty?


# Answer




We never know, how many elements are in stack.  We can execute `pop`
instruction as many times as we like, and we will always get something from the
memory. Each time the `rsp` value will increase. 

Being unable to reason about the amount of elements in stack, this question has no sense.
