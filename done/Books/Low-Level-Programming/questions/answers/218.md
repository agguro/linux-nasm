# Question 218



What is the purpose of `NULL`?


# Answer



It is a specific defined value of "an uninitialized pointer". Without it
we could never make a difference between valid and invalid pointers. Imagine 
some pointer equal to 42. What does it mean? Is it a garbage pointer to a random
memory location or is there really something meaningful starting at this address?
As we have `NULL` we can be sure that any other pointer is valid (or the 
programmer has mistaken).
