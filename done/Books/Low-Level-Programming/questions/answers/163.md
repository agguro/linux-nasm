# Question 163



 What is the purpose of `&` and `*` operators?


# Answer



* The ampersand operator takes an address of an lvalue-type expression.
* The asterisk takes a pointer and dereferences it. So, it takes the contents of
memory from the cells starting at some address. How many cells are in game 
depends on the pointer type. For example:

```c 
int x;
int* px = &x;
*x = 10;  
```

Here by doing `*x = 10` we affect 4 cells since `x` has a type of `int*`.
