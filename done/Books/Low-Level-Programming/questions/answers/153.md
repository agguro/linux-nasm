# Question 153



Why is `break` necessary at the end of each `switch` case? 


# Answer



If you omit `break`, the execution will continue to the next case. For example,
we jumped to `case 2`, but since `break` is absent, we will fall to `case 3` 
afterwards:


```c
int main(void) {
    int x = 2;

    switch (x) {
        case 1: puts( "1" ); break;
        case 2: puts( "2" ); 
        case 3: puts( "3" ); break;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the output will be as follows:

```
2
3
```
