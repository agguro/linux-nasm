# Question 123


Why do we need a separate case for `branch` and  `0branch`?


# Answer



By default, in compile mode when we see a number `n` we emit `lit n` so that 
the number would not be interpreted as a word address. However, `0branch` and 
`branch` are unique because they accept a number as an operand. So, they should 
be translated into e.g. `0branch 42` directly and not `0branch lit 42`.
