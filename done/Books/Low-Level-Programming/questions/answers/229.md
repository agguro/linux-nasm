# Question 229


 
 When are the string literals stored in __.rodata__? 


# Answer



To be completely honest, there are no restrictions on where they should be stored.
In reality: 
* Small literals can be encoded as immediate values. For example:
 
```c
char x[] = "hello";
```

will lead to one `mov` instruction with an operand being the string itself.

* Long strings and those strings that we only need an address are stored in __.rodata__.

```c
char* x = "hello";
char* x = "asdkajnsdkajsnd kajsndkajnsd kjansdkjaskdjn asdasdasd sad hello";

```
