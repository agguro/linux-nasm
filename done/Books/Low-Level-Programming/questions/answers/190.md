# Question 190


 
 What is the difference between a declaration and a definition?


# Answer



* For global variables any declaration is also a definition. The definition 
without the variable being initialized to a certain value can act as a 
declaration.

```c
int g1;         // declaration or definition
int g2 = 20;    // definition
```

* For functions a declaration has no body, while definition specifies one.

```c
int double( int x );  // declaration
int double( int x ) { // definition 
    return x * 2;
}

```
