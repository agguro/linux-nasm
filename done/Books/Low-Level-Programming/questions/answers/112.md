# Question 112


How are the model specific registers used in the system call mechanism?


# Answer



To perform `syscall` the CPU:

* Loads cs from `STAR`;
* Changes `rflags` with regards to `SFMASK`;
* Saves `rip` into `rcx`; and
* Initializes rip with `LSTAR` value and takes new `cs` and `ss` from `STAR`.
