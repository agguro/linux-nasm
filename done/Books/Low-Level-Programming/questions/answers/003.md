# Question 3


What are registers?


# Answer




__Registers__ are memory cells placed directly on the CPU chip. Circuit-wise
they are much faster, but they are also more complicated and expensive. Register
accesses do not use the bus. The response time is quite small and usually equals
a couple of CPU cycles
