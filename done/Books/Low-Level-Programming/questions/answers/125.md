Which models of computation do you know?


# Answer



So far we did study the von Neumann model of computations "on steroids", with 
numerous extensions. The model of computation of most imperative languages 
(C, Java, D, python etc) derives from it.  We have also studied stack machines,
such as Forth. It relies on stack so heavily that it is usually put in another 
class, despite resembling von Neumann model from many sides. 

In this book we will also study Finite State Machines and Formal Grammars.

Besides, you might have had experience with Prolog and Functional Programming (which is
based on Lambda Calculus), or event-driven frameworks, which are all of different kind.
