# Question 247



What are the levels of Chomsky hierarchy? 


# Answer



	
3. __The regular grammars__ (parsed by finite automatons)
2. __Context-free grammars__ with rules of form:

```
nonterminal ::= <sequence  of  terminal  and  nonterminal  symbols>
```

1.	The __context-sensitive grammars__ have rules of form:
```
a A b ::= a y b
```

`a` and `b` denote an arbitrary (possibly empty) sequence of terminals and/or
nonterminals, `y` denotes a non-empty sequence of terminals and/or nonterminals,
and `A` is the nonterminal being expanded

0. 	The __unrestricted grammars__ have rules of form:

```
sequence of terminal and nonterminal symbols ::=
        sequence of terminal and nonterminal symbols
```
