# Question 156




 Is `printf` checking the types of its arguments?


# Answer


 
No, `print` relies on the programmer to give correct format
specifiers as parts of its first argument.  

This code will _not_ output `42.0` but rather a totaly random integer (a 
case of undefined behavior ).

```c
printf("%d", 42.0 ); 
```
