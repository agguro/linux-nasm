What is the difference between Little and Big Endian?


# Answer




In Little Endian, the first byte of a multibyte number holds the least 
significant digits, in Big Endian it holds the most significant ones.

For example, take 0x1122334455667788

Little Endian:

* starting address: 0x88
* start + 1 : 0x77
* ...
* start + 7 : 0x11

The bits inside each byte are stored in a natural order!

In Big Endian, the bytes are also stored in a  natural order:

* starting address: 0x11
* start + 1 : 0x22
* ...
* start + 7 : 0x77
