# Question 194




 How the functions defined in other files can be called?


# Answer



1. Add its declaration before the usage
2. Make sure that the file with that function is compiled as well
3. Make sure the linker accepts the `.o` file with the compiled function body.

For example:

```c
/* lib.c */
int square( int x ) {
    return x * x; 
} 
```

```c
/* main.c */
#include <stdio.h>

int square( int x );

int main( int x ) {
    printf( "Square of 42 is %d\n", square( 42 ) );
    return 0;
    } 
```

Then these files should be compiled as follows:

```
> gcc -c -o main.o main.c 
> gcc -c -o lib.o  lib.c
> gcc -o main   main.o lib.o
```
