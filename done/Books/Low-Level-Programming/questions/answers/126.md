What is a finite state machine?


# Answer



__Deterministic finite state machine__ (deterministic finite automaton) is an
abstract machine that acts on input string, following some rules.  
The following parts should be provided:

1.  A set of states.
2.  Alphabet -- a set of symbols that can appear in the input string.
3.  A selected start state.
4.  One or multiple selected end states
5.  Rules of transition between states. Each rule consumes a symbol from input string.
Its action can be described as: "if automaton is in state S and an input symbol C
occurs, the next current state will be Z."

The non-deterministic machine differs in two poins:
* In any state, there can be _multiple_ transitions for the _same_ input symbol. In case of such transitions we get _multiple_ active states.
* When an input symbol is analyzed, the transitions from all active states are
performed. When there is no rule to follow from one of the active states, this
state "dies" and becomes inactive as if FSM did not reach it. 
* FSM accepts an input string if at least one execution branch has led us to a
final state.
