What is relocation?


# Answer



__Relocation__ is a process of assigning definitive addresses to various program parts
and changing the program code the way all links are attributed correctly. We are
speaking about all kinds of memory accesses by absolute addresses. Relocation is
needed, for example, when the program consists of multiple modules, which are
referencing one another. The order in which they will be placed in memory is not
yet fixed, so the absolute addresses are not determined.
