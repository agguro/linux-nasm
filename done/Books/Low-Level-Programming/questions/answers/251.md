# Question 251


 
 What is the undefined behavior?


# Answer



When the language standard does not define any behavior for a language construct 
in a certain situation, we call it __undefined behavior__. In this case, the
compiler can make the compiled program do whatever it considers necessary, but
once we get to such case, there are absolutely no guarantees about what happens
next.
