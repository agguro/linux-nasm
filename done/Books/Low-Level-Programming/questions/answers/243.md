What does a grammar consist of? 


# Answer



Formally, a grammar consists of
*	 A finite set of terminal symbols.
*	 A finite set of nonterminal symbols.
*	 A finite set of production rules, which hold information about language structure.
*	 A starting symbol, a nonterminal which will correspond to any correctly constructed
language statement. It is a starting point for us to parse any statement.
