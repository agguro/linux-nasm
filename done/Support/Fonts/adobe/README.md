## Missing fonts
I've added the fonts required for the documentation generation.  If make everything should fail, the reason could be that some fonts aren't available on your system.

## Installation
To install these fonts, copy the adobe directory them to ~/.local/share/fonts (user only) or to /usr/share/fonts/truetype (system wide, must be root).
