<h2 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2: Running NASM</h2>
<h3 id="section-2.1">2.1 NASM Command-Line Syntax</h3>
<p>To assemble a file, you issue a command of the form</p>
<pre>
nasm -f &lt;format&gt; &lt;filename&gt; [-o &lt;output&gt;]
</pre>
<p>For example,</p>
<pre>
nasm -f elf myfile.asm
</pre>
<p>will assemble <code>myfile.asm</code> into an ELF object file
<code>myfile.o</code>. And</p>
<pre>
nasm -f bin myfile.asm -o myfile.com
</pre>
<p>will assemble <code>myfile.asm</code> into a raw binary file
<code>myfile.com</code>.</p>
<p>To produce a listing file, with the hex codes output from NASM displayed
on the left of the original sources, use the <code>-l</code> option to give
a listing file name, for example:</p>
<pre>
nasm -f coff myfile.asm -l myfile.lst
</pre>
<p>To get further usage instructions from NASM, try typing</p>
<pre>
nasm -h
</pre>
<p>The option <code>--help</code> is an alias for the <code>-h</code>
option.</p>
<p>If you use Linux but aren't sure whether your system is
<code>a.out</code> or ELF, type</p>
<pre>
file nasm
</pre>
<p>(in the directory in which you put the NASM binary when you installed
it). If it says something like</p>
<pre>
nasm: ELF 32-bit LSB executable i386 (386 and up) Version 1
</pre>
<p>then your system is <code>ELF</code>, and you should use the option
<code>-f elf</code> when you want NASM to produce Linux object files. If it
says</p>
<pre>
nasm: Linux/i386 demand-paged executable (QMAGIC)
</pre>
<p>or something similar, your system is <code>a.out</code>, and you should
use <code>-f aout</code> instead (Linux <code>a.out</code> systems have
long been obsolete, and are rare these days.)</p>
<p>Like Unix compilers and assemblers, NASM is silent unless it goes wrong:
you won't see any output at all, unless it gives error messages.</p>
<h4 id="section-2.1.1">2.1.1 The <code>-o</code> Option: Specifying the Output File Name</h4>
<p>NASM will normally choose the name of your output file for you;
precisely how it does this is dependent on the object file format. For
Microsoft object file formats (<code>obj</code>, <code>win32</code> and
<code>win64</code>), it will remove the <code>.asm</code> extension (or
whatever extension you like to use &ndash; NASM doesn't care) from your
source file name and substitute <code>.obj</code>. For Unix object file
formats (<code>aout</code>, <code>as86</code>, <code>coff</code>,
<code>elf32</code>, <code>elf64</code>, <code>elfx32</code>,
<code>ieee</code>, <code>macho32</code> and <code>macho64</code>) it will
substitute <code>.o</code>. For <code>dbg</code>, <code>rdf</code>,
<code>ith</code> and <code>srec</code>, it will use <code>.dbg</code>,
<code>.rdf</code>, <code>.ith</code> and <code>.srec</code>, respectively,
and for the <code>bin</code> format it will simply remove the extension, so
that <code>myfile.asm</code> produces the output file <code>myfile</code>.</p>
<p>If the output file already exists, NASM will overwrite it, unless it has
the same name as the input file, in which case it will give a warning and
use <code>nasm.out</code> as the output file name instead.</p>
<p>For situations in which this behaviour is unacceptable, NASM provides
the <code>-o</code> command-line option, which allows you to specify your
desired output file name. You invoke <code>-o</code> by following it with
the name you wish for the output file, either with or without an
intervening space. For example:</p>
<pre>
nasm -f bin program.asm -o program.com 
nasm -f bin driver.asm -odriver.sys
</pre>
<p>Note that this is a small o, and is different from a capital O , which
is used to specify the number of optimization passes required. See
<a href="#section-2.1.24">section 2.1.24</a>.</p>
<h4 id="section-2.1.2">2.1.2 The <code>-f</code> Option: Specifying the Output File Format</h4>
<p>If you do not supply the <code>-f</code> option to NASM, it will choose
an output file format for you itself. In the distribution versions of NASM,
the default is always <code>bin</code>; if you've compiled your own copy of
NASM, you can redefine <code>OF_DEFAULT</code> at compile time and choose
what you want the default to be.</p>
<p>Like <code>-o</code>, the intervening space between <code>-f</code> and
the output file format is optional; so <code>-f elf</code> and
<code>-felf</code> are both valid.</p>
<p>A complete list of the available output file formats can be given by
issuing the command <code>nasm -h</code>.</p>
<h4 id="section-2.1.3">2.1.3 The <code>-l</code> Option: Generating a Listing File</h4>
<p>If you supply the <code>-l</code> option to NASM, followed (with the
usual optional space) by a file name, NASM will generate a source-listing
file for you, in which addresses and generated code are listed on the left,
and the actual source code, with expansions of multi-line macros (except
those which specifically request no expansion in source listings: see
<a href="nasmdoc4.html#section-4.3.11">section 4.3.11</a>) on the right.
For example:</p>
<pre>
nasm -f elf myfile.asm -l myfile.lst
</pre>
<p>If a list file is selected, you may turn off listing for a section of
your source with <code>[list -]</code>, and turn it back on with
<code>[list +]</code>, (the default, obviously). There is no "user form"
(without the brackets). This can be used to list only sections of interest,
avoiding excessively long listings.</p>
<h4 id="section-2.1.4">2.1.4 The <code>-L</code> Option: Additional or Modified Listing Info</h4>
<p>Use this option to specify listing output details.</p>
<p>Supported options are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>-Lb</code> show builtin macro packages (standard and
<code>%use</code>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-Ld</code> show byte and repeat counts in decimal, not hex</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-Le</code> show the preprocessed input</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-Lf</code> ignore <code>.nolist</code> and force listing output</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-Lm</code> show multi-line macro calls with expanded parameters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-Lp</code> output a list file in every pass, in case of errors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-Ls</code> show all single-line macro definitions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-Lw</code> flush the output after every line (very slow, mainly
useful to debug NASM crashes)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-L+</code> enable <em>all</em> listing options except
<code>-Lw</code> (very verbose)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These options can be enabled or disabled at runtime using the
<code>%pragma list options</code> directive:</p>
<pre>
%pragma list options [+|-]flags...
</pre>
<p>For example, to turn on the <code>d</code> and <code>m</code> flags but
disable the <code>s</code> flag:</p>
<pre>
%pragma list options +dm -s
</pre>
<p>For forward compatility reasons, an undefined flag will be ignored.
Thus, a new flag introduced in a newer version of NASM can be specified
without breaking older versions. Listing flags will always be a single
alphanumeric character and are case sensitive.</p>
<h4 id="section-2.1.5">2.1.5 The <code>-M</code> Option: Generate Makefile Dependencies</h4>
<p>This option can be used to generate makefile dependencies on stdout.
This can be redirected to a file for further processing. For example:</p>
<pre>
nasm -M myfile.asm &gt; myfile.dep
</pre>
<h4 id="section-2.1.6">2.1.6 The <code>-MG</code> Option: Generate Makefile Dependencies</h4>
<p>This option can be used to generate makefile dependencies on stdout.
This differs from the <code>-M</code> option in that if a nonexisting file
is encountered, it is assumed to be a generated file and is added to the
dependency list without a prefix.</p>
<h4 id="section-2.1.7">2.1.7 The <code>-MF</code> Option: Set Makefile Dependency File</h4>
<p>This option can be used with the <code>-M</code> or <code>-MG</code>
options to send the output to a file, rather than to stdout. For example:</p>
<pre>
nasm -M -MF myfile.dep myfile.asm
</pre>
<h4 id="section-2.1.8">2.1.8 The <code>-MD</code> Option: Assemble and Generate Dependencies</h4>
<p>The <code>-MD</code> option acts as the combination of the
<code>-M</code> and <code>-MF</code> options (i.e. a filename has to be
specified.) However, unlike the <code>-M</code> or <code>-MG</code>
options, <code>-MD</code> does <em>not</em> inhibit the normal operation of
the assembler. Use this to automatically generate updated dependencies with
every assembly session. For example:</p>
<pre>
nasm -f elf -o myfile.o -MD myfile.dep myfile.asm
</pre>
<p>If the argument after <code>-MD</code> is an option rather than a
filename, then the output filename is the first applicable one of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the filename set in the <code>-MF</code> option;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the output filename from the <code>-o</code> option with <code>.d</code>
appended;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the input filename with the extension set to <code>.d</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="section-2.1.9">2.1.9 The <code>-MT</code> Option: Dependency Target Name</h4>
<p>The <code>-MT</code> option can be used to override the default name of
the dependency target. This is normally the same as the output filename,
specified by the <code>-o</code> option.</p>
<h4 id="section-2.1.10">2.1.10 The <code>-MQ</code> Option: Dependency Target Name (Quoted)</h4>
<p>The <code>-MQ</code> option acts as the <code>-MT</code> option, except
it tries to quote characters that have special meaning in Makefile syntax.
This is not foolproof, as not all characters with special meaning are
quotable in Make. The default output (if no <code>-MT</code> or
<code>-MQ</code> option is specified) is automatically quoted.</p>
<h4 id="section-2.1.11">2.1.11 The <code>-MP</code> Option: Emit phony targets</h4>
<p>When used with any of the dependency generation options, the
<code>-MP</code> option causes NASM to emit a phony target without
dependencies for each header file. This prevents Make from complaining if a
header file has been removed.</p>
<h4 id="section-2.1.12">2.1.12 The <code>-MW</code> Option: Watcom Make quoting style</h4>
<p>This option causes NASM to attempt to quote dependencies according to
Watcom Make conventions rather than POSIX Make conventions (also used by
most other Make variants.) This quotes <code>#</code> as <code>$#</code>
rather than <code>\#</code>, uses <code>&amp;</code> rather than
<code>\</code> for continuation lines, and encloses filenames containing
whitespace in double quotes.</p>
<h4 id="section-2.1.13">2.1.13 The <code>-F</code> Option: Selecting a Debug Information Format</h4>
<p>This option is used to select the format of the debug information
emitted into the output file, to be used by a debugger (or <em>will</em>
be). Prior to version 2.03.01, the use of this switch did <em>not</em>
enable output of the selected debug info format. Use <code>-g</code>, see
<a href="#section-2.1.14">section 2.1.14</a>, to enable output. Versions
2.03.01 and later automatically enable <code>-g</code> if <code>-F</code>
is specified.</p>
<p>A complete list of the available debug file formats for an output format
can be seen by issuing the command <code>nasm -h</code>. Not all output
formats currently support debugging output.</p>
<p>This should not be confused with the <code>-f dbg</code> output format
option, see <a href="nasmdoc8.html#section-8.14">section 8.14</a>.</p>
<h4 id="section-2.1.14">2.1.14 The <code>-g</code> Option: Enabling Debug Information.</h4>
<p>This option can be used to generate debugging information in the
specified format. See <a href="#section-2.1.13">section 2.1.13</a>. Using
<code>-g</code> without <code>-F</code> results in emitting debug info in
the default format, if any, for the selected output format. If no debug
information is currently implemented in the selected output format,
<code>-g</code> is <em>silently ignored</em>.</p>
<h4 id="section-2.1.15">2.1.15 The <code>-X</code> Option: Selecting an Error Reporting Format</h4>
<p>This option can be used to select an error reporting format for any
error messages that might be produced by NASM.</p>
<p>Currently, two error reporting formats may be selected. They are the
<code>-Xvc</code> option and the <code>-Xgnu</code> option. The GNU format
is the default and looks like this:</p>
<pre>
filename.asm:65: error: specific error message
</pre>
<p>where <code>filename.asm</code> is the name of the source file in which
the error was detected, <code>65</code> is the source file line number on
which the error was detected, <code>error</code> is the severity of the
error (this could be <code>warning</code>), and
<code>specific error message</code> is a more detailed text message which
should help pinpoint the exact problem.</p>
<p>The other format, specified by <code>-Xvc</code> is the style used by
Microsoft Visual C++ and some other programs. It looks like this:</p>
<pre>
filename.asm(65) : error: specific error message
</pre>
<p>where the only difference is that the line number is in parentheses
instead of being delimited by colons.</p>
<p>See also the <code>Visual C++</code> output format,
<a href="nasmdoc8.html#section-8.5">section 8.5</a>.</p>
<h4 id="section-2.1.16">2.1.16 The <code>-Z</code> Option: Send Errors to a File</h4>
<p>Under <code>MS-DOS</code> it can be difficult (though there are ways) to
redirect the standard-error output of a program to a file. Since NASM
usually produces its warning and error messages on <code>stderr</code>,
this can make it hard to capture the errors if (for example) you want to
load them into an editor.</p>
<p>NASM therefore provides the <code>-Z</code> option, taking a filename
argument which causes errors to be sent to the specified files rather than
standard error. Therefore you can redirect the errors into a file by typing</p>
<pre>
nasm -Z myfile.err -f obj myfile.asm
</pre>
<p>In earlier versions of NASM, this option was called <code>-E</code>, but
it was changed since <code>-E</code> is an option conventionally used for
preprocessing only, with disastrous results. See
<a href="#section-2.1.22">section 2.1.22</a>.</p>
<h4 id="section-2.1.17">2.1.17 The <code>-s</code> Option: Send Errors to <code>stdout</code></h4>
<p>The <code>-s</code> option redirects error messages to
<code>stdout</code> rather than <code>stderr</code>, so it can be
redirected under <code>MS-DOS</code>. To assemble the file
<code>myfile.asm</code> and pipe its output to the <code>more</code>
program, you can type:</p>
<pre>
nasm -s -f obj myfile.asm | more
</pre>
<p>See also the <code>-Z</code> option, <a href="#section-2.1.16">section
2.1.16</a>.</p>
<h4 id="section-2.1.18">2.1.18 The <code>-i</code> Option: Include File Search Directories</h4>
<p>When NASM sees the <code>%include</code> or <code>%pathsearch</code>
directive in a source file (see
<a href="nasmdoc4.html#section-4.6.1">section 4.6.1</a>,
<a href="nasmdoc4.html#section-4.6.2">section 4.6.2</a> or
<a href="nasmdoc3.html#section-3.2.3">section 3.2.3</a>), it will search
for the given file not only in the current directory, but also in any
directories specified on the command line by the use of the <code>-i</code>
option. Therefore you can include files from a macro library, for example,
by typing</p>
<pre>
nasm -ic:\macrolib\ -f obj myfile.asm
</pre>
<p>(As usual, a space between <code>-i</code> and the path name is allowed,
and optional).</p>
<p>Prior NASM 2.14 a path provided in the option has been considered as a
verbatim copy and providing a path separator been up to a caller. One could
implicitly concatenate a search path together with a filename. Still this
was rather a trick than something useful. Now the trailing path separator
is made to always present, thus <code>-ifoo</code> will be considered as
the <code>-ifoo/</code> directory.</p>
<p>If you want to define a <em>standard</em> include search path, similar
to <code>/usr/include</code> on Unix systems, you should place one or more
<code>-i</code> directives in the <code>NASMENV</code> environment variable
(see <a href="#section-2.1.35">section 2.1.35</a>).</p>
<p>For Makefile compatibility with many C compilers, this option can also
be specified as <code>-I</code>.</p>
<h4 id="section-2.1.19">2.1.19 The <code>-p</code> Option: Pre-Include a File</h4>
<p>NASM allows you to specify files to be <em>pre-included</em> into your
source file, by the use of the <code>-p</code> option. So running</p>
<pre>
nasm myfile.asm -p myinc.inc
</pre>
<p>is equivalent to running <code>nasm myfile.asm</code> and placing the
directive <code>%include "myinc.inc"</code> at the start of the file.</p>
<p><code>--include</code> option is also accepted.</p>
<p>For consistency with the <code>-I</code>, <code>-D</code> and
<code>-U</code> options, this option can also be specified as
<code>-P</code>.</p>
<h4 id="section-2.1.20">2.1.20 The <code>-d</code> Option: Pre-Define a Macro</h4>
<p>Just as the <code>-p</code> option gives an alternative to placing
<code>%include</code> directives at the start of a source file, the
<code>-d</code> option gives an alternative to placing a
<code>%define</code> directive. You could code</p>
<pre>
nasm myfile.asm -dFOO=100
</pre>
<p>as an alternative to placing the directive</p>
<pre>
%define FOO 100
</pre>
<p>at the start of the file. You can miss off the macro value, as well: the
option <code>-dFOO</code> is equivalent to coding <code>%define FOO</code>.
This form of the directive may be useful for selecting assembly-time
options which are then tested using <code>%ifdef</code>, for example
<code>-dDEBUG</code>.</p>
<p>For Makefile compatibility with many C compilers, this option can also
be specified as <code>-D</code>.</p>
<h4 id="section-2.1.21">2.1.21 The <code>-u</code> Option: Undefine a Macro</h4>
<p>The <code>-u</code> option undefines a macro that would otherwise have
been pre-defined, either automatically or by a <code>-p</code> or
<code>-d</code> option specified earlier on the command lines.</p>
<p>For example, the following command line:</p>
<pre>
nasm myfile.asm -dFOO=100 -uFOO
</pre>
<p>would result in <code>FOO</code> <em>not</em> being a predefined macro
in the program. This is useful to override options specified at a different
point in a Makefile.</p>
<p>For Makefile compatibility with many C compilers, this option can also
be specified as <code>-U</code>.</p>
<h4 id="section-2.1.22">2.1.22 The <code>-E</code> Option: Preprocess Only</h4>
<p>NASM allows the preprocessor to be run on its own, up to a point. Using
the <code>-E</code> option (which requires no arguments) will cause NASM to
preprocess its input file, expand all the macro references, remove all the
comments and preprocessor directives, and print the resulting file on
standard output (or save it to a file, if the <code>-o</code> option is
also used).</p>
<p>This option cannot be applied to programs which require the preprocessor
to evaluate expressions which depend on the values of symbols: so code such
as</p>
<pre>
%assign tablesize ($-tablestart)
</pre>
<p>will cause an error in preprocess-only mode.</p>
<p>For compatiblity with older version of NASM, this option can also be
written <code>-e</code>. <code>-E</code> in older versions of NASM was the
equivalent of the current <code>-Z</code> option,
<a href="#section-2.1.16">section 2.1.16</a>.</p>
<h4 id="section-2.1.23">2.1.23 The <code>-a</code> Option: Don't Preprocess At All</h4>
<p>If NASM is being used as the back end to a compiler, it might be
desirable to suppress preprocessing completely and assume the compiler has
already done it, to save time and increase compilation speeds. The
<code>-a</code> option, requiring no argument, instructs NASM to replace
its powerful preprocessor with a stub preprocessor which does nothing.</p>
<h4 id="section-2.1.24">2.1.24 The <code>-O</code> Option: Specifying Multipass Optimization</h4>
<p>Using the <code>-O</code> option, you can tell NASM to carry out
different levels of optimization. Multiple flags can be specified after the
<code>-O</code> options, some of which can be combined in a single option,
e.g. <code>-Oxv</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>-O0</code>: No optimization. All operands take their long forms,
if a short form is not specified, except conditional jumps. This is
intended to match NASM 0.98 behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-O1</code>: Minimal optimization. As above, but immediate operands
which will fit in a signed byte are optimized, unless the long form is
specified. Conditional jumps default to the long form unless otherwise
specified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-Ox</code> (where <code>x</code> is the actual letter
<code>x</code>): Multipass optimization. Minimize branch offsets and signed
immediate bytes, overriding size specification unless the
<code>strict</code> keyword has been used (see
<a href="nasmdoc3.html#section-3.7">section 3.7</a>). For compatibility
with earlier releases, the letter <code>x</code> may also be any number
greater than one. This number has no effect on the actual number of passes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-Ov</code>: At the end of assembly, print the number of passes
actually executed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>-Ox</code> mode is recommended for most uses, and is the
default since NASM 2.09.</p>
<p>Note that this is a capital <code>O</code>, and is different from a
small <code>o</code>, which is used to specify the output file name. See
<a href="#section-2.1.1">section 2.1.1</a>.</p>
<h4 id="section-2.1.25">2.1.25 The <code>-t</code> Option: Enable TASM Compatibility Mode</h4>
<p>NASM includes a limited form of compatibility with Borland's
<code>TASM</code>. When NASM's <code>-t</code> option is used, the
following changes are made:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>local labels may be prefixed with <code>@@</code> instead of
<code>.</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>size override is supported within brackets. In TASM compatible mode, a
size override inside square brackets changes the size of the operand, and
not the address type of the operand as it does in NASM syntax. E.g.
<code>mov eax,[DWORD val]</code> is valid syntax in TASM compatibility
mode. Note that you lose the ability to override the default address type
for the instruction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>unprefixed forms of some directives supported (<code>arg</code>,
<code>elif</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>endif</code>, <code>if</code>,
<code>ifdef</code>, <code>ifdifi</code>, <code>ifndef</code>,
<code>include</code>, <code>local</code>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="section-2.1.26">2.1.26 The <code>-w</code> and <code>-W</code> Options: Enable or Disable Assembly Warnings</h4>
<p>NASM can observe many conditions during the course of assembly which are
worth mentioning to the user, but not a sufficiently severe error to
justify NASM refusing to generate an output file. These conditions are
reported like errors, but come up with the word `warning' before the
message. Warnings do not prevent NASM from generating an output file and
returning a success status to the operating system.</p>
<p>Some conditions are even less severe than that: they are only sometimes
worth mentioning to the user. Therefore NASM supports the <code>-w</code>
command-line option, which enables or disables certain classes of assembly
warning. Such warning classes are described by a name, for example
<code>label-orphan</code>; you can enable warnings of this class by the
command-line option <code>-w+label-orphan</code> and disable it by
<code>-w-label-orphan</code>.</p>
<p>The current warning classes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>all</code> is an group alias for <em>all</em> warning classes.
Thus, <code>-w+all</code> enables all available warnings, and
<code>-w-all</code> disables warnings entirely (since NASM 2.13).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>bad-pragma</code> is a backwards compatibility alias for
<code>pragma-bad</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>bnd</code> warns about ineffective use of the <code>BND</code>
prefix when the <code>JMP</code> instruction is converted to the
<code>SHORT</code> form. This should be extremely rare since the short
<code>JMP</code> only is applicable to jumps inside the same module, but if
it is legitimate, it may be necessary to use <code>bnd jmp dword</code>.</p>
<p>Enabled by default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>db-empty</code> warns about a <code>DB</code>, <code>DW</code>,
etc declaration with no operands, producing no output. This is permitted,
but often indicative of an error. See
<a href="nasmdoc3.html#section-3.2.1">section 3.2.1</a>.</p>
<p>Enabled by default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>environment</code> warns if a nonexistent environment variable is
accessed using the <code>%!</code> preprocessor construct (see
<a href="nasmdoc4.html#section-4.11.2">section 4.11.2</a>.) Such
environment variables are treated as empty (with this warning issued)
starting in NASM 2.15; earlier versions of NASM would treat this as an
error.</p>
<p>Enabled by default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>float</code> is a group alias for all warning classes prefixed by
<code>float-</code>; currently <code>float-denorm</code>,
<code>float-overflow</code>, <code>float-toolong</code>, and
<code>float-underflow</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>float-denorm</code> warns about denormal floating point constants.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><code>label-orphan</code> warns about source lines which contain no
instruction but define a label without a trailing colon. This is most
likely indicative of a typo, but is technically correct NASM syntax (see

<p>Enabled by default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>label-redef</code> warns if a label is defined more than once, but
the value is identical. It is an unconditional error to define the same
label more than once to <em>different</em> values.</p>
<p>Disabled by default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>label-redef-late</code> the value of a label changed during the
final, code-generation pass. This may be the result of strange use of the
preprocessor. This is very likely to produce incorrect code and may end up
being an unconditional error in a future version of NASM.</p>
<p>Enabled and promoted to error by default.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><code>macro-def-case-single</code> warns when a single-line macro is
defined both case sensitive and case insensitive. The new macro definition
will override (shadow) the original one, although the original macro is not
deleted, and will be re-exposed if the new macro is deleted with
<code>%undef</code>, or, if the original macro is the case insensitive one,
the macro call is done with a different case.</p>
<p>Enabled by default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>macro-def-greedy-single</code> definition shadows greedy macro
warns when a single-line macro is defined which would match a previously
existing greedy definition. The new macro definition will override (shadow)
the original one, although the original macro is not deleted, and will be

</li>
<li>
<p><code>macro-params-legacy</code> warns about multi-line macros being
invoked with the wrong number of parameters, but for bug-compatibility with
NASM versions older than 2.15, NASM tried to fix up the parameters to match
the legacy behavior and call the macro anyway. This can happen in certain
cases where there are empty arguments without braces, sometimes as a result
of macro expansion.</p>
<p>The legacy behavior is quite strange and highly context-dependent, and
can be disabled with:</p>
<pre>
     %pragma preproc sane_empty_expansion true

</li>
<li>
<p><code>obsolete-removed</code> warns for an instruction which has been
removed from the architecture, and is no longer included in the CPU

opcode prefix on CPUs newer than the first generation 8086.</p>
<p>Enabled by default.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p><code>regsize</code> warns about a register with implicit size (such as
<code>EAX</code>, which is always 32 bits) been given an explicit size
specification which is inconsistent with the size of the named register,
e.g. <code>WORD EAX</code>. <code>DWORD EAX</code> or <code>WORD AX</code>
are permitted, and do not trigger this warning. Some registers which <em>do
not</em> imply a specific size, such as <code>K0</code>, may need this
specification unless the instruction itself implies the instruction size:</p>
<pre>
     KMOVW K0,[foo]          ; Permitted, KMOVW implies 16 bits 
     KMOV  WORD K0,[foo]     ; Permitted, WORD K0 specifies instruction size 
     KMOV  K0,WORD [foo]     ; Permitted, WORD [foo] specifies instruction size

</li>
<li>
<p><code>zeroing</code> a <code>RESx</code> directive was used in a section
which contains initialized data, and the output format does not support

<p><code>zext-reloc</code> warns that a relocation has been zero-extended
due to limitations in the output format.</p>
<p>Enabled by default.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since version 2.15, NASM has group aliases for all prefixed warnings, so
they can be used to enable or disable all warnings in the group. For
example, &ndash;w+float enables all warnings with names starting with
float-*.</p>
<p>Since version 2.00, NASM has also supported the
<code>gcc</code>&ndash;like syntax <code>-Wwarning-class</code> and
<code>-Wno-warning-class</code> instead of <code>-w+warning-class</code>
and <code>-w-warning-class</code>, respectively; both syntaxes work
identically.</p>
<p>The option <code>-w+error</code> or <code>-Werror</code> can be used to
treat warnings as errors. This can be controlled on a per warning class
basis (<code>-w+error=</code><em>warning-class</em> or
<code>-Werror=</code><em>warning-class</em>); if no <em>warning-class</em>
is specified NASM treats it as <code>-w+error=all</code>; the same applies
to <code>-w-error</code> or <code>-Wno-error</code>, of course.</p>
<p>In addition, you can control warnings in the source code itself, using
the <code>[WARNING]</code> directive. See
<a href="nasmdoc7.html#section-7.13">section 7.13</a>.</p>
<h4 id="section-2.1.27">2.1.27 The <code>-v</code> Option: Display Version Info</h4>
<p>Typing <code>NASM -v</code> will display the version of NASM which you
are using, and the date on which it was compiled.</p>
<p>You will need the version number if you report a bug.</p>
<p>For command-line compatibility with Yasm, the form <code>--v</code> is
also accepted for this option starting in NASM version 2.11.05.</p>
<h4 id="section-2.1.28">2.1.28 The <code>--(g|l)prefix</code>, <code>--(g|l)postfix</code> Options.</h4>
<p>The <code>--(g)prefix</code> options prepend the given argument to all
<code>extern</code>, <code>common</code>, <code>static</code>, and
<code>global</code> symbols, and the <code>--lprefix</code> option prepends
to all other symbols. Similarly, <code>--(g)postfix</code> and
<code>--lpostfix</code> options append the argument in the exactly same way
as the <code>--xxprefix</code> options does.</p>
<p>Running this:</p>
<pre>
nasm -f macho --gprefix _
</pre>
<p>is equivalent to place the directive with
<code>%pragma macho gprefix _</code> at the start of the file
(<a href="nasmdoc7.html#section-7.10">section 7.10</a>). It will prepend
the underscore to all global and external variables, as C requires it in
some, but not all, system calling conventions.</p>
<h4 id="section-2.1.29">2.1.29 The <code>--pragma</code> Option</h4>
<p>NASM accepts an argument as <code>%pragma</code> option, which is like
placing a <code>%pragma</code> preprocess statement at the beginning of the
source. Running this:</p>
<pre>
nasm -f macho --pragma "macho gprefix _"
</pre>
<p>is equivalent to the example in <a href="#section-2.1.28">section
2.1.28</a>. See <a href="nasmdoc4.html#section-4.10">section 4.10</a>.</p>
<h4 id="section-2.1.30">2.1.30 The <code>--before</code> Option</h4>
<p>A preprocess statement can be accepted with this option. The example
shown in <a href="#section-2.1.29">section 2.1.29</a> is the same as
running this:</p>
<pre>
nasm -f macho --before "%pragma macho gprefix _"
</pre>
<h4 id="section-2.1.31">2.1.31 The <code>--limit-X</code> Option</h4>
<p>This option allows user to setup various maximum values after which NASM
will terminate with a fatal error rather than consume arbitrary amount of
compute time. Each limit can be set to a positive number or
<code>unlimited</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>--limit-passes</code>: Number of maximum allowed passes. Default
is <code>unlimited</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>--limit-stalled-passes</code>: Maximum number of allowed
unfinished passes. Default is 1000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>--limit-macro-levels</code>: Define maximum depth of macro
expansion (in preprocess). Default is 10000</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>--limit-macro-tokens</code>: Maximum number of tokens processed
during single-line macro expansion. Default is 10000000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>--limit-mmacros</code>: Maximum number of multi-line macros
processed before returning to the top-level input. Default is 100000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>--limit-rep</code>: Maximum number of allowed preprocessor loop,
defined under <code>%rep</code>. Default is 1000000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>--limit-eval</code>: This number sets the boundary condition of
allowed expression length. Default is 8192 on most systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>--limit-lines</code>: Total number of source lines allowed to be
processed. Default is 2000000000.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, set the maximum line count to 1000:</p>
<pre>
nasm --limit-lines 1000
</pre>
<p>Limits can also be set via the directive <code>%pragma limit</code>, for
example:</p>
<pre>
%pragma limit lines 1000
</pre>
<h4 id="section-2.1.32">2.1.32 The <code>--keep-all</code> Option</h4>
<p>This option prevents NASM from deleting any output files even if an
error happens.</p>
<h4 id="section-2.1.33">2.1.33 The <code>--no-line</code> Option</h4>
<p>If this option is given, all <code>%line</code> directives in the source
code are ignored. This can be useful for debugging already preprocessed
code. See <a href="nasmdoc4.html#section-4.11.1">section 4.11.1</a>.</p>
<h4 id="section-2.1.34">2.1.34 The <code>--reproducible</code> Option</h4>
<p>If this option is given, NASM will not emit information that is
inherently dependent on the NASM version or different from run to run (such
as timestamps) into the output file.</p>
<h4 id="section-2.1.35">2.1.35 The <code>NASMENV</code> Environment Variable</h4>
<p>If you define an environment variable called <code>NASMENV</code>, the
program will interpret it as a list of extra command-line options, which
are processed before the real command line. You can use this to define
standard search directories for include files, by putting <code>-i</code>
options in the <code>NASMENV</code> variable.</p>
<p>The value of the variable is split up at white space, so that the value
<code>-s -ic:\nasmlib\</code> will be treated as two separate options.
However, that means that the value <code>-dNAME="my name"</code> won't do
what you might want, because it will be split at the space and the NASM
command-line processing will get confused by the two nonsensical words
<code>-dNAME="my</code> and <code>name"</code>.</p>
<p>To get round this, NASM provides a feature whereby, if you begin the
<code>NASMENV</code> environment variable with some character that isn't a
minus sign, then NASM will treat this character as the separator character
for options. So setting the <code>NASMENV</code> variable to the value
<code>!-s!-ic:\nasmlib\</code> is equivalent to setting it to
<code>-s -ic:\nasmlib\</code>, but <code>!-dNAME="my name"</code> will
work.</p>
<p>This environment variable was previously called <code>NASM</code>. This
was changed with version 0.98.31.</p>
<h3 id="section-2.2">2.2 Quick Start for MASM Users</h3>
<p>If you're used to writing programs with MASM, or with TASM in
MASM-compatible (non-Ideal) mode, or with <code>a86</code>, this section
attempts to outline the major differences between MASM's syntax and NASM's.
If you're not already used to MASM, it's probably worth skipping this
section.</p>
<h4 id="section-2.2.1">2.2.1 NASM Is Case-Sensitive</h4>
<p>One simple difference is that NASM is case-sensitive. It makes a
difference whether you call your label <code>foo</code>, <code>Foo</code>
or <code>FOO</code>. If you're assembling to <code>DOS</code> or
<code>OS/2</code> <code>.OBJ</code> files, you can invoke the
<code>UPPERCASE</code> directive (documented in
<a href="nasmdoc8.html#section-8.4">section 8.4</a>) to ensure that all
symbols exported to other code modules are forced to be upper case; but
even then, <em>within</em> a single module, NASM will distinguish between
labels differing only in case.</p>
<h4 id="section-2.2.2">2.2.2 NASM Requires Square Brackets For Memory References</h4>
<p>NASM was designed with simplicity of syntax in mind. One of the design
goals of NASM is that it should be possible, as far as is practical, for
the user to look at a single line of NASM code and tell what opcode is
generated by it. You can't do this in MASM: if you declare, for example,</p>
<pre>
foo     equ     1 
bar     dw      2
</pre>
<p>then the two lines of code</p>
<pre>
        mov     ax,foo 
        mov     ax,bar
</pre>
<p>generate completely different opcodes, despite having identical-looking
syntaxes.</p>
<p>NASM avoids this undesirable situation by having a much simpler syntax
for memory references. The rule is simply that any access to the
<em>contents</em> of a memory location requires square brackets around the
address, and any access to the <em>address</em> of a variable doesn't. So
an instruction of the form <code>mov ax,foo</code> will <em>always</em>
refer to a compile-time constant, whether it's an <code>EQU</code> or the
address of a variable; and to access the <em>contents</em> of the variable
<code>bar</code>, you must code <code>mov ax,[bar]</code>.</p>
<p>This also means that NASM has no need for MASM's <code>OFFSET</code>
keyword, since the MASM code <code>mov ax,offset bar</code> means exactly
the same thing as NASM's <code>mov ax,bar</code>. If you're trying to get
large amounts of MASM code to assemble sensibly under NASM, you can always
code <code>%idefine offset</code> to make the preprocessor treat the
<code>OFFSET</code> keyword as a no-op.</p>
<p>This issue is even more confusing in <code>a86</code>, where declaring a
label with a trailing colon defines it to be a `label' as opposed to a
`variable' and causes <code>a86</code> to adopt NASM-style semantics; so in
<code>a86</code>, <code>mov ax,var</code> has different behaviour depending
on whether <code>var</code> was declared as <code>var: dw 0</code> (a
label) or <code>var dw 0</code> (a word-size variable). NASM is very simple
by comparison: <em>everything</em> is a label.</p>
<p>NASM, in the interests of simplicity, also does not support the hybrid
syntaxes supported by MASM and its clones, such as
<code>mov ax,table[bx]</code>, where a memory reference is denoted by one
portion outside square brackets and another portion inside. The correct
syntax for the above is <code>mov ax,[table+bx]</code>. Likewise,
<code>mov ax,es:[di]</code> is wrong and <code>mov ax,[es:di]</code> is
right.</p>
<h4 id="section-2.2.3">2.2.3 NASM Doesn't Store Variable Types</h4>
<p>NASM, by design, chooses not to remember the types of variables you
declare. Whereas MASM will remember, on seeing <code>var dw 0</code>, that
you declared <code>var</code> as a word-size variable, and will then be
able to fill in the ambiguity in the size of the instruction
<code>mov var,2</code>, NASM will deliberately remember nothing about the
symbol <code>var</code> except where it begins, and so you must explicitly
code <code>mov word [var],2</code>.</p>
<p>For this reason, NASM doesn't support the <code>LODS</code>,
<code>MOVS</code>, <code>STOS</code>, <code>SCAS</code>, <code>CMPS</code>,
<code>INS</code>, or <code>OUTS</code> instructions, but only supports the
forms such as <code>LODSB</code>, <code>MOVSW</code>, and
<code>SCASD</code>, which explicitly specify the size of the components of
the strings being manipulated.</p>
<h4 id="section-2.2.4">2.2.4 NASM Doesn't <code>ASSUME</code></h4>
<p>As part of NASM's drive for simplicity, it also does not support the
<code>ASSUME</code> directive. NASM will not keep track of what values you
choose to put in your segment registers, and will never
<em>automatically</em> generate a segment override prefix.</p>
<h4 id="section-2.2.5">2.2.5 NASM Doesn't Support Memory Models</h4>
<p>NASM also does not have any directives to support different 16-bit
memory models. The programmer has to keep track of which functions are
supposed to be called with a far call and which with a near call, and is
responsible for putting the correct form of <code>RET</code> instruction
(<code>RETN</code> or <code>RETF</code>; NASM accepts <code>RET</code>
itself as an alternate form for <code>RETN</code>); in addition, the
programmer is responsible for coding CALL FAR instructions where necessary
when calling <em>external</em> functions, and must also keep track of which
external variable definitions are far and which are near.</p>
<h4 id="section-2.2.6">2.2.6 Floating-Point Differences</h4>
<p>NASM uses different names to refer to floating-point registers from
MASM: where MASM would call them <code>ST(0)</code>, <code>ST(1)</code> and
so on, and <code>a86</code> would call them simply <code>0</code>,
<code>1</code> and so on, NASM chooses to call them <code>st0</code>,
<code>st1</code> etc.</p>
<p>As of version 0.96, NASM now treats the instructions with `nowait' forms
in the same way as MASM-compatible assemblers. The idiosyncratic treatment
employed by 0.95 and earlier was based on a misunderstanding by the
authors.</p>
<h4 id="section-2.2.7">2.2.7 Other Differences</h4>
<p>For historical reasons, NASM uses the keyword <code>TWORD</code> where
MASM and compatible assemblers use <code>TBYTE</code>.</p>
<p>Historically, NASM does not declare uninitialized storage in the same
way as MASM: where a MASM programmer might use
<code>stack db 64 dup (?)</code>, NASM requires <code>stack resb 64</code>,
intended to be read as `reserve 64 bytes'. For a limited amount of
compatibility, since NASM treats <code>?</code> as a valid character in
symbol names, you can code <code>? equ 0</code> and then writing
<code>dw ?</code> will at least do something vaguely useful.</p>
<p>As of NASM 2.15, the MASM syntax is also supported.</p>
<p>In addition to all of this, macros and directives work completely
differently to MASM. See <a href="nasmdoc4.html">chapter 4</a> and
<a href="nasmdoc7.html">chapter 7</a> for further details.</p>
