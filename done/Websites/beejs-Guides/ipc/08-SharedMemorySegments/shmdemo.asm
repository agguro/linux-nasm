;description: Demonstration on shared memory segments based on an example from Beej's Guide to IPC.
;
;remark:      The C code only use shmget to "get and create" a shared emory segment.  In assembly language
;             we must take care of this.  That's why the syscall shmget appears twice.  Once to get and
;             create a shared memory segment, the second time if the shared memory segment already exists
;             and we want to attach to it.
